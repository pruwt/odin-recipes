      </li>
      <li>1-2 tsp. lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Clean the fish and lightly slice the fish, giving the fish cuts not all
        the way through (mitai), this will help the fish obtain more flavour. Do
        it on both sides. Mix all the ingredients and marinate the fish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next place the fish on a fish BBQ grill basket and close it so the fish
        doesnâ€™t fall. Next grill the fish on a charcoal grill until the fish is
        well cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crush or grind the chilies, garlic and salt together.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a sufuria, add the coconut cream, the crushed garlic, chilies and
        salt, turmeric and lemon juice. Cook until the sauce thickens, taste for
        salt and lemon before removing from the stove.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the sauce is thick, remove from stove and let it coli.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next when the fish is ready, open up the fish BBQ basket and start
        brushing the sauce on the fish, while the fish is still on the charcoal
        grill.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you find the fish is sticking to the BBQ basket, let the fish coli
        before opening the basket, otherwise continue brushing the fish with
        sauce on both sides while still placing the fish on the hot stove so the
        fish can get nice aroma of the smoke from the sauce falling into the
        charcoal, at the same time keeping an eye on the fish not to burn. When
        the fish is well coated with the sauce on both sides, remove from the
        grill and serve
